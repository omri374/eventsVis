# eventsVis
A tool for analyzing and visualizing time series descrete events.

This tool uses the shiny framework [shiny.rstudio.com] for visualizing events.
In order to run it, you need to have R [https://mran.microsoft.com/download] and Rstudio [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/].

This tool allows you to inspect events on a timeline, or to inspect the distribution of events across sessions.
It also allows you to query your dataset easily using SQL.

In order to run it, open the project in R studio, open the server.R file and click on the play button. Another option is to call 
    R -e "shiny::runApp('~/eventsVis')"


Additional visualizations and interaction ideas are mostly welcome.
